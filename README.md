For now please check example directory.


## ToDo

1. unify font sizes
1. legends
  1. reasonable placement
  1. more flexible (also add a "handle"-like approach as in `matplotlib`)
1. enable usage of labels
1. documentation
1. utility functions
  1. single plot
  1. enable `n x m` grid and wrap plot definition and axes sharing automatically
  1. add `TGraph` and related classes to be handled correctly, also `TF1` etc.
1. `YAML` or `JSON` based interface, declarative approach (extract from what I have in my plotting repo)
1. update examples, one based on what is at https://github.com/AliceO2Group/Run3Analysisvalidation/blob/master/FirstAnalysis/efficiency_studies.py
